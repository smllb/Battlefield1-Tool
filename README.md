#Simple AHK Panel with GUI

This panel was meant to be used mostly with the Medic class and 2 healing items in an assault-like gameplay, but by disabling the DoubleHeal option the panel can be used with any class in the game. 

User can enable or disable the following functions:

 * AutoWalk - Will press W and hold till the user press W again or hold the key manually.
 * AutoSpot - For each click, a Q will be spammed for a few seconds so the enemies can be spotted easily.
 * DropDoubleHeal - After pressing 3, AHK will spam 4 so both healings will go to the floor at the same time.
 
PageDown key will hold space (if you die just press it instead of holding space everytime)
Also Dr.Strange screaming image in the GUI(why not?)
